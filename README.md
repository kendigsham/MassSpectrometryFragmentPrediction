# MassSpectrometryFragmentPrediction

### This is a repository for the code of my Master's project:
#### Metabolites Mass Spectrometry Fragment Prediction with Deep Learning
- An autoencoder was trained.
- The latent vectors of the autoencoder were used for the prediction of the presence or absence of mass spectrometry fragment peaks.
